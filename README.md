Introduction
------------

Pi-Music is a web-based client for the MPD application. It is modelled after
the Music application on IOS and is intended to run on a Raspberry Pi.

Requirements
------------

* MPD 0.16.5 or higher (it may work on earlier version, but I haven't tested it).
* A web server (Apache or Lighttpd)
* PHP 5.4.x or greated (I _think_ it will run on PHP 5.3.x, but I haven't tested it).

Installation
------------

The easiest way is via Composer. I'll be setting up a page on packagist.org shortly.
